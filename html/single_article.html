                    <h1><b>Why did I decide to join Andela technical leadership program?</b></h1>
                    <img src="../images/pascal.jpg" alt="my pic" width="100%" height="900px" />
                    <p class="article__text">My name is Bizimungu Pascal, a student at the University 
                        of Rwanda College of Education. I am particularly interested in learning
                         programming during this endless holiday. I love coding and therefore 
                         I had started a new career as a JavaScript full-stack software engineer. I have started this journey by practicing
                         programming myself at home and preparing myself to become a software engineer. <br>
                         <br >
                         I was doing all of this alone as self-thought, there was no any kind of advice from experts or technical assistance for every time I needed help. 
                         My progress was very slow and there was no experience or skills of working in a team as an effect of being alone in this journey.
                         <br /><br />
                         After realising that there is a funded program that is helping someone to get the necessary technical and professional 
                         skills to become a full-stack JavaScript software engineer called  Andela Technical Leadership Program, I became more interested in this program.
                          I decided to apply for this program as a nine months career accelerator program implemented by Andela in partnership with the Ministry of ICT. This program is open to young
                          Rwandese nationals who are passionate about becoming software developers to become world-class software engineers.
                          <h1>What I have learned so far and hope to gain from the program?</h1>
                          I have been selected to be part of the Andela Technical Leadership Program Cohort 2 on July 28 2020 which I am grateful for. I learned a lot; I am still learning and we learn by doing in this program.<br /><br />
                          And also, I have whatever it takes to become a world-class software engineer in this program and I am not alone. I am working in a team called Phoenix of 14 members. We support each other because we have the same 
                          bjective and we have every kind of assistance we need in this program, like personal development advice and training, technical assistance from technical team leads, and so on.
                          <h1>Where do I see myself 6-12 months after the program?</h1>
                          I am passionate about becoming a software engineer who will use computers to address the different problems that our society is facing.  
                          I hope by the end of this program I am looking for myself to have technical and professional skills demanded by the world marketplace. And also, I will have 
                          the fastest track to my employment as a software engineer in the African tech ecosystem.
